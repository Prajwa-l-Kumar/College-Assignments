# Assignment-1

1. Write a Python program to find average of three numbers entered by the user.

2. Write a python program to compute a person's income tax. Assume following tax laws:
  • All taxpayers are charged a flat tax rate of 20%.
  • All taxpayers are allowed a $10,000 standard deduction.
  • For each dependent, a taxpayer is allowed an additional $3,000 deduction.
  • Gross income must be entered to the nearest penny.
  Gross Income and the number of dependents must be asked from the user. Hint:
  Taxable income = Gross Income - Standard deduction - (Dependent deduction * No. of dependents)
  Tax = Taxable Income * Tax Rate

3. Write a program that asks the user for a number of seconds and prints out how many minutes and seconds that is. For instance, 200 seconds is 3 minutes and 20 seconds.   [Hint: Use the //operator to get minutes and the % operator to get seconds.]

4. Write a python program to add three numbers 25+’25’+25.0 and produce result 75 as string.

5. Write a program that prints out the sine and cosine of the angles ranging from 0 to 345◦ in 15◦ increments. Each result should be rounded to 4 decimal places. Sample    output is shown below:
